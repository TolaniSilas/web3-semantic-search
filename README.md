# Web3 Semantic Search
The Web3 Semantic Search Project is a decentralized content retrieval system where users upload content, such as images and text, which can then be retrieved by other users using natural-language search (via query or prompt). The system utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to handle the retrieval process, employing several foundational models, such as LLMs and VLMs, in its integration. I enabled the system to be integrated into a web-based application as API endpoints using Python FASTAPI. This project promotes decentralization, allowing content to be owned and controlled by its rightful owners, while also implementing an incentive-based model to reward creators.
