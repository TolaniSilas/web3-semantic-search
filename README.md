# Web3 Semantic Search
The **Web3 Semantic Search Project** is a decentralized content retrieval system in which users upload content - such as images and blogs - that can later be retrieved by other users using natural-language search (via queries or prompts). It was developed on **Camp Network** - a Layer-1 blockchain built to modernize intellectual property (IP) infrastructure and power the next generation of AI Agents on verifiable IP.

This system utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) architecture to handle the retrieval process, employing several foundational models, such as **LLMs** and **VLMs**, in its integration. I enabled the system to be integrated into a web-based application as API endpoints using **Python FASTAPI**. 

This project stands to promote a world of **decentralization** and **ownership of intellectual property (IP)**, allowing content (blogs, images, nft pfp) to be owned and controlled by its rightful owners, while also implementing an incentive-based model to reward creators.
